# Vim Basics

## A guide for effectively using vim mode in Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or Sublime Text 3

### What is Vim?

Vim is a command-line text editor.
The name stands for "Vi improved" (it is based upon an earlier text editor called Vi).

### What makes Vi(m) special?

Vim is a _modal_ editor (meaning it has difference modes).
Each mode provides a different way of interacting with your text.
With these modes, you can effectively and efficiently manipulate text without leaving your keyboard.

We will focus on three of Vim's modes:
- Insert
- Normal
- Visual

**Insert** mode is most similar to text editors with which you are familiar.
Each key you press (e.g. a, b, \<enter\>, :, #) is inserted directly into the document.

**Normal** mode allows you to move your cursor around the document.

**Visual** mode is for selecting text within the document (to cut or copy).

### Why should I use Vim?

I don't know why (or if) you should use Vim. I can tell you why I use it though.

1. Ease of coding
    - I started using Vim mode because I was tired of jumping from home row to Control+Arrow, Home, and End all the time.
      Vim lets me type without constantly moving around my keyboard.

2. Consistency
    - In the course of one week, I can write code from 4 different keyboards, 3 difference OSes, and 4 different text editors.
      Before using Vim, I would fumble hotkeys when I changed editors or OSes.
      I can go between any combination of keyboard, OS, and editor and have the same experience with Vim.
