# Vim Basics

## A guide for effectively using vim mode in Visual Studio or Sublime Text 3

### What is Vim?

Vim is a command-line text editor.
The name stands for "Vi improved" (it is based upon an earlier text editor called Vi).

### What makes Vi(m) special?

Vim is a _modal_ editor (meaning it has difference modes).
Each mode provides a different way of interacting with your text.
With these modes, you can effectively and efficiently manipulate text without leaving your keyboard.

We will focus on three of Vim's modes:
- Insert
- Normal
- Visual

**Insert** mode is most similar to text editors with which you are familiar.
Each key you press (e.g. a, b, <enter>, :, #) is inserted directly into the document.

**Normal** mode allows you to move your cursor around the document.

**Visual** mode is for selecting text within the document (to cut or copy).
